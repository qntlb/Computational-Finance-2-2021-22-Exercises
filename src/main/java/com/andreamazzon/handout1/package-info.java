/**
 * This package contains the code for the solution of the exercises of the first
 * handout. In particular, we look again at the simulation of a Brownian motion
 * and at the pricing of options using the Finmath library. You also find a PDF
 * with the solution of the exercise about interest rates, as well as a short
 * note about asset-or-nothing options.
